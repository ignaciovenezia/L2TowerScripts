# L2TowerScripts
A collection of my old L2Tower scripts written in LUA. 

These are some of my old LUA scripts that I made while learning to code back in 2009/2010.   

Excuse the large file sizes lines wise, L2Tower only admitted one-file scripts and/or plugins, so a very complex plugin could go into the thousands of lines for the single file.
Scripts are more of my early work whilst plugins are more of my later work. I choose this selection because it not only shows my progress during my time with L2Tower, but also because they showcase how intricate this line of work can be.
